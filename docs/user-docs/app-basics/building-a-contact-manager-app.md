# Building a Contact Manager App

Congratulations, you are about to create your first Aurelia 2 application. Before we get started, there are only a couple of prerequisites you need to fulfil.

## Setting Up Your Machine

You'll need a computer \(obviously\) as well as Node.js and Npm installed.

To install Node.js, you can obtain an installer for all major operating systems [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions. Downloading the LTS version of Node is recommended as the latest version can contain bugs and be incompatible.

Ideally, you will also want a code editor. There are a few free ones around, but we highly recommend Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor, which is not only free but has a lot of community support in the form of plugins and theme.

You can find a download for Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## What You Will Be Learning

The idea behind building this contact manager is you will learn Aurelia fundamentals that will apply to mostly all Aurelia applications you find yourself working on.

* How to create a new Aurelia application from scratch
* How to break your UI into components
* Working with user entered data
* How to leverage routing
* How to work with multiple viewports in the router to create dynamically sectioned views
* How to utilize Aurelia's templating syntax to work with collections of data, bind to events and more

## Creating A New Aurelia Project

Now, we get to the fun stuff. To create a new Aurelia project, we do not need to download anything, and we do not need to install any packages or CLI's either.

By running `npx makes aurelia` in your command line of choice, the Aurelia CLI will automatically obtain the latest version of Aurelia and settings to present you. You will be presented three options initially when you run makes, for the purposes of this tutorial we will choose option 2, "Default TypeScript Aurelia 2 App" which will create a TypeScript starter app for us.

Once the creation process has finished, you will be presented with instructions on how to run your newly created app. Make sure you run the app to ensure that everything was setup correctly, before you proceed with the creation of our application.
